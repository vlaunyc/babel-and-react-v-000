# Babel and React

## Overview

In this lesson, we'll unpack what **Babel** brings to the table when developing React applications.

## Objectives

1. Learn what Babel is
2. Learn how Babel integrates with React
3. Frame Babel's relative importance at this stage in learning React

If you don't have time to procrastinate and [read the wiki][origin-myth], and want to get on with learning programming, allow us to provide the [TL;DR][TL;DR] and why it is relevant to the Babel tool we use:

The Tower of Babel was a colossal construction project long ago. It was being built by a united humanity speaking the same language, with the intention of reaching such heights that heaven itself could be accessed. While it was being constructed, the God in the story, (for debated reasons), afflicted the united humans by confounding their speech. This ensured the once united humanity could no longer communicate.<sup>1</sup> What made this ambitious project possible was that multiple cultures, languages, idioms, etc. were all using _a common standard_.

As you may already know, JavaScript (based on the ECMAScript [ES] standard) is an evolving language. Over time we have had several iterations. For the most part, ECMAScript's evolution has changed to incorporate more features and language constructs over time (think ES6 arrow functions, class syntax, `let`, and `const` vs. their absence in ES5!). This resembled the "confounded" state described above. What was needed was a way to move all, various standards of JavaScript usage to the same standard. **That** is what the Babel program does &mdash; it makes all JavaScript versions emit a common, standard code.

Less metaphorically, Babel gained popularity because it [compiled/transpiled][transpile-compile] newer ES6 syntax and language features into the older (and more widely deployed, at that time) ES5. This was especially important when ES6 came out because many browsers had not yet updated their JavaScript engines to interpret the new language features of ES6.

As of 2018, you are less likely to encounter browsers **not** implementing ES6 syntax.<sup>2</sup> For example, open up your browser's developer console and attempt to assign `let y = 4; console.log(y)`. Better believe Chrome Boi won't complain!

#### Then why is Babel important?

If most popular browsers have moved to integrate ES6+ syntax, then why is Babel
"still a thing?"

Babel's competency was in reading in one type of text and making in-place
transformations such that another type of text came out. Some developers
realized that by processing their code with Babel, they could write
code that's terse and convenient and then have Babel turn that code into
verbose, compliant JavaScript code.

Let's take as an example how non-standard JSX can be transformed, via Babel,
into compliant JavaScript. Succinctly, **Babel turns JSX into normal JavaScript
written with the React library**:

```JavaScript
var profile = (
  <div>
    <img src="avatar.png" className="profile" />
    <h3>{[user.firstName, user.lastName].join(' ')}</h3>
  </div>;
)
```

...when the above is run through Babel, we receive:

```JavaScript
var profile = (
  React.createElement("div", null,
  React.createElement("img", { src: "avatar.png", className: "profile" }),
  React.createElement("h3", null, [user.firstName, user.lastName].join(" ")))
);
```

While you don't **strictly** need Babel as a dependency when writing React
code, not having it means you have to write in the non-JSX syntax seen in the
output above. My fingers think that typing that first one is better (because
they're lazy). My brain also likes that JSX paints an HTML picture in my mind's
eye. JSX removes the burden on the programmer to calculate an intermediary
picture of the DOM in their brain when reading this code. For now, we will be
teaching and writing with the pre-babel-compiled (first syntax above) JSX in
our React applications.

#### Not Just For JSX

In addition to the JSX magic it provides, Babel can also compile other features and syntactic sugar that is not yet, or never will be, a part of ECMAScript! One example of this is a babel plugin that enables the usage of [language features proposed for ECMAScript, but not yet implemented][babel-stage-2].

## Summary

You have just been introduced to a tool you likely have not worked directly with before. Luckily, its straight forward to summarize:

**Babel** enables us to use syntax that browsers won't natively recognize by **pre-compiling** it into syntax that browsers _do_ natively recognize. When used with React, this can (and in our case will) include, but not be limited to, digesting JSX.

## Looking Forward

That was a chunk of new information, and we have even more coming up. If this is your first time being exposed to a tool like Babel, treat yourself. Stand up, stretch your legs, look at a real human that's not in meme format: you deserve it. When you come back, we will get started on **Webpack** in the following lesson.
